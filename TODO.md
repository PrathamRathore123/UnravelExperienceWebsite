- [ ] Adjust section height to be shorter on mobile (e.g., h-[60vh] on mobile, h-[80vh] on larger screens)
- [ ] Make buttons stack vertically on very small screens (flex-col) and horizontally on small screens and up (sm:flex-row)
- [ ] Adjust button gap to be smaller on mobile (gap-2) and larger on small screens (sm:gap-4)
- [ ] Ensure font sizes and padding are appropriate for mobile
