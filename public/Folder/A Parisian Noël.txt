Day 2 — Christmas Markets, Movie Magic & Cozy Paris
Step into the world of Emily in Paris on a private 2.5-hour walking tour. Whether you're a devoted fan or simply love exploring Paris through a fun and fashionable lens, this tour is for you.
Wander through charming squares, elegant boulevards, and stylish neighborhoods where Emily lived, worked, and made unforgettable memories. From her cozy apartment in the Latin Quarter to the stunning Palais Garnier — featured for a date gone wrong and a dramatic fashion shoot — you'll step right into the show's most memorable scenes.
Stop by Gabriel's restaurant (Terra Nera in real life) and pass Galerie Patrick Fourtin, just below the fictional Agence Grateau office near the Louvre. To cover more ground, hop on the Paris metro during the tour — just like Emily! Stop at her local bakery near Place de l'Estrapade for a fresh pain au chocolat — her favorite Parisian snack.
Post-tour, your driver picks you up and takes you to the Ritz Paris for festive afternoon tea. Delicate pastries. Holiday ambience. The kind of moment you remember in February.
After tea, you're free to explore until evening. Make your way back to the hotel and get ready for your next experience.
Later, celebrate the magic of Christmas in Paris with a private golf cart tour showcasing the city's most dazzling holiday lights. Unlike crowded bus tours, this intimate experience lets you glide through iconic avenues and landmarks: Champs-Élysées, Place Vendôme, Galeries Lafayette, and more — all bathed in sparkling Christmas decorations. Stay warm with cozy blankets while your friendly local guide shares festive stories and Parisian holiday traditions.
